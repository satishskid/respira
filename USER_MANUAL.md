## Understanding the 5 Protocols

RESPIRA syncs with your **circadian rhythm**—your body's 24-hour biological clock. Each protocol is timed to when your biology is most responsive.

### 🌅 Sunrise Protocol (07:00–08:00)
**Purpose:** Wake up your system with energy

**What You'll Do:**
- Physiological sighs (deep breath + sip of air, then big exhale)

**The Science:**
- Sharpens your Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)

**Duration:** 5–8 minutes  
**Best For:** Mornings, starting your day, setting intentions

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't hear the AI voice"

**Check:**
